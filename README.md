Setup of the `better-minimal-webgl-template` is as follows:
1. Download and unzip the template.
2. Copy the `WebGLTemplates` folder into the `Assets` folder.
3. File -> Build Settings... -> WebGL -> Player Settings... -> Select the "BetterMinimal" template.
4. Enter color in the "Background" field.
5. Enter "false" in the "Scale to fit" field to disable scaling.
6. Enter "true" in the "Optimize for pixel art" field to use CSS more appropriate for pixel art.

### Running a Unity WebGL Build
1. Install the "Live Server" VS Code extension.
2. Open the WebGL build output directory with VS Code.
